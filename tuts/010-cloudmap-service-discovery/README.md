# AWS Cloud Map service discovery

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement service discovery with AWS Cloud Map using the AWS CLI. You'll learn to create namespaces, register services, configure health checks, and discover services dynamically for microservices architectures.

You can either run the automated script `cloudmap-service-discovery.sh` to execute all operations automatically with comprehensive error handling and resource cleanup, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the `cloudmap-service-discovery.md` tutorial to understand each AWS CLI command and concept in detail. The script includes interactive prompts and built-in safeguards, while the tutorial provides detailed explanations of features and best practices.
