# AWS CloudFormation getting started

This tutorial introduces AWS CloudFormation, demonstrating how to use infrastructure as code to provision and manage AWS resources using templates in a predictable and repeatable way.

You can either run the automated script `cloudformation-gs.sh` to execute all the steps automatically, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the `cloudformation-gs.md` tutorial to understand each operation in detail.
