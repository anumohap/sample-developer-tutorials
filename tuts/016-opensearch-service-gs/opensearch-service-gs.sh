# Amazon OpenSearch Service Getting Started Script - Version 8 Fixed
# This script creates an OpenSearch domain, uploads data, searches documents, and cleans up resources
# Based on the tested and working 4-tutorial-final.md

# FIXES IN V8-FIXED:
# 1. Fixed syntax error with regex pattern matching
# 2. Fixed access policy to be more permissive and work with fine-grained access control
# 3. Added proper resource-based policy that allows both IAM and internal user database access
# 4. Improved authentication test with better error handling
# 5. Better debugging and troubleshooting information
