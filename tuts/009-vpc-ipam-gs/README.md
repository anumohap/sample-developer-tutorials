# Vpc Ipam Gs

This tutorial demonstrates how to set up IP Address Manager (IPAM) for Amazon VPC using the AWS CLI. You'll learn to create IPAM pools, manage IP address allocation, monitor IP usage, and implement centralized IP address management across multiple VPCs.

You can either run the automated script `vpc-ipam-gs.sh` to execute all operations automatically with comprehensive error handling and resource cleanup, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the `vpc-ipam-gs.md` tutorial to understand each AWS CLI command and concept in detail. The script includes interactive prompts and built-in safeguards, while the tutorial provides detailed explanations of features and best practices.
