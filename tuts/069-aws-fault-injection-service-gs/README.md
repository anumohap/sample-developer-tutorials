# AWS Fault Injection Service getting started

This tutorial guides you through using AWS Fault Injection Service to run CPU stress tests on an Amazon EC2 instance. You'll learn how to create the necessary IAM roles, set up a CloudWatch alarm as a stop condition, create and run an experiment, and monitor the results to understand how your applications respond to fault conditions.

You can either run the automated shell script (`aws-fault-injection-service-getting-started.sh`) to quickly set up and execute the entire tutorial, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the tutorial document (`aws-fault-injection-service-getting-started.md`) to manually perform each step and gain a deeper understanding of the AWS Fault Injection Service workflow.
