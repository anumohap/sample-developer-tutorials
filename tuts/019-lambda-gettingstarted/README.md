# AWS Lambda getting started

This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to AWS Lambda, covering how to create, deploy, and manage serverless functions that run your code without provisioning or managing servers.

You can either run the automated script `lambda-gettingstarted.sh` to execute all the steps automatically, or follow the step-by-step instructions in the `lambda-gettingstarted.md` tutorial to understand each operation in detail.
