# create a simplified script

verify that the most recent version of the script is named correctly. It should be named "2-cli-script-vX.sh" with X being the iteration version, which should be the highest version of any script in the folder. If the name is something like "2-cli-script-final-fixed.sh" it is not always clear if this is the most recent version. rename the file if needed.

create a simplified version of the script. don't include any error handling. just run the cli commands like a customer would when learning the API for the first time. this is not a production script and doesn't need to organize commands into functions. as long as the script runs end to end and doesn't leave any resources behind, it's good. call the script 2-simple-script.sh
